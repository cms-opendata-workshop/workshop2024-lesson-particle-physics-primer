This lesson provides resources for you to learn about particle physics. It is not a 
complete overview and depending on your level, you may need to review some introductory 
physics concepts.

We hope this is a solid jumping-off-point for anyone new to this field and that it gives you 
the necessary background to get the most out of this workshop. 

If you feel there are other materials that could be useful to future participants, 
please email the organizers (see *Contact* link at bottom of this page).
