## Videos

### The CMS experiment

A nice overview of the CMS experiment from the [CMS experiment's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CMSExperiment).
If you only watch one of these videos, this is the one!

### The LHC

A oldie, but a goodie. A discussion of the Large Hadron Collider, by Don Lincoln of Fermilab. You can find more of his videos
over on [Fermilab's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@fermilab).

### What are we doing and what comes next?

A discussion of what CERN and the LHC experiments have accomplished and what comes next? 
From Cleo Abram's [YouTube science popularizing channel "Huge if true"](https://www.youtube.com/@CleoAbram).

### Watch a movie!

If you have time, grab some family and friends and watch [Particle Fever](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385956/), the 2013 documentary 
about the discovery of the Higgs Boson. 

From Wikipedia:

Particle Fever is a 2013 American documentary film tracking the first round of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland. The film follows the experimental physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) who run the experiments, as well as the theoretical physicists who attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the LHC's results. The film begins in 2008 with the first firing of the LHC and concludes in 2012 with the successful identification of the Higgs boson
